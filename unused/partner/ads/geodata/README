
PHPADSNEW GEOTRACKING TRY-OUT
=============================

This package contains a free try-out version of the GeoIP database 
created by Maxmind, which allows you to try the Geotargeting features 
found in phpAdsNew. This database was last updated in Januari 2003. 
The free version of the database is derived from APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC
and RIPE WHOIS databases.

Also available from MaxMind is the GeoIP Country Premium Edition, which 
offers a significant improvement in accuracy over the free database and 
other commerical databases based only on WHOIS records. MaxMind uses a 
number of Internet mapping tools to identify and correct IP addresses 
where the end-user location does not match the ISP location on the WHOIS 
record. The GeoIP Country Premium Edition is updated every month.

To buy an up-to-date version of this database, please take a look at our
website:  http://www.phpadsnew.com/one/features-geo.html


How to install this database?
-----------------------------
To install the database you need to copy the GeoIP.dat file to a 
directory on the server which is running phpAdsNew. It is best 
practice to copy it to a directory outside of the webserver's
document root, otherwise visitors of your website might be able
to download the database.

The next step is to let phpAdsNew know the location of the database.
First you need to log in as the administrator and go to the 'Settings'
page. Next choose 'Main settings' and 'Host information and Geotargeting'.
The second group of settings called 'Geotargeting' contains
the settings you will need to modify.

As the type of geotracking database you will need to select 'MaxMind GeoIP'.
You also need to specify the location of the database. For example
if you copied the database to the directory /opt/www.website.com/,
you will need to specify /opt/www.website.com/GeoIP.dat.
Please make also sure you have enabled the evaluation of delivery 
limitations on the 'Invocation and delivery settings' page, otherwise 
geotracking won't work at all.

If you are using verbose statistics it is also possible to keep track
of where your visitors are coming from. To enable the logging of geotracking
data go to the 'Statistics Settings' page and enable 'Log the country of 
the visitor in the statistics'.

In order to use this try-out version you will need to have phpAdsNew 
2.0 RC 2 or higher. Older versions may be compatible with this database,
but are not tested. Versions older than dev 16092002 are not compatible.


How target banners to countries?
--------------------------------
After you have installed this try-out version of the GeoIP database,
there will be two additional delivery limitations available to you,
called 'Country' and 'Continent'. You can use these to target your
banners. For more information about how to use delivery limitations
and the 'Country' and 'Continent' limitations, please read the 
chapters 'Delivery limitations' and 'Geotargeting' in user guide,
which should be distributed along with phpAdsNew. You can also read
them online at: http://www.phpadsnew.com/one/about-manual.html
