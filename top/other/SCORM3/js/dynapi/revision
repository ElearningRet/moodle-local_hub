Version 2001.01.25
------------------
This release features many changes to the DynAPI.  Most 
noticable is a new layer creation system, as well as 
requiring the script tags after the DynAPI.include() 
statements must be closed before using any DynAPI 
related functions.  Also, the widgets are finally back.  
There is a new loadPanel widget for loading external 
files as well as list, path animation (slide), button, 
scrollpanel, and label widgets.  This release also 
features the first API documentation for the 
distribution.  Please post and bugs to the mailing 
list.  There are too many changes to list, but
